# Why do I make?

Tomáš Roj - Opportunity to help other people with their problems using best possible solutions.

Martin Malý - Making is my passion. I love the feeling I am creating a whole new thing I have created in my mind before.

Konstantin Láska - I just enjoy it.

Matěj V. - I really love feel that I could make something what I imagine in my head. I could solve problems, make a device to make my life easier or just make something I like.
